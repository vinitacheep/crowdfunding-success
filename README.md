# Prediction of Surgical Crowdfunding Campaign Success using NLP

In this code, we will apply deep learning to extract word embeddings from campaign text, and then
develop a binary classification LSTM network using these word embeddings to
predict whether a campaign is able to raise its requested funds.

## Requirements
This code requires Torch. If you're on Ubuntu, installing Torch in your home directory may look something like: 

```
$ pip install torch
```

In addition, run the import statements in [import.py] to install all necessary packages.
