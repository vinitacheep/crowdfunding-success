            "some of you may already know, but just a few days before christmas last year, my talented, intelligent, and kindhearted brother, chris rocher, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. over the course of the next few weeks, we were given even more difficult news that the cancer has progressed to stage iv and has spread to the point that radiation and surgery are not options.despite all of this, chris has decided to fight with the support of his family and wife sue. this means 6 months of intensive chemotherapy, natural remedies, and second opinions, all of which have been steadily depleting their savings, despite both chris and sue continuing to work and balance caring for their 3 and a half year old, mitchell. i am starting this campaign in hopes to help them through this stressful situation and alleviate some of the overwhelming financial burden. many have already been incredibly generous, offering meals and delivery services to help them through the day-to-day, of which we are so grateful. this is just another avenue to provide them with assistance and every little bit helps!since i have known them, my brother chris and his wife sue have been strong, family-oriented, and extremely kind people. nearly 13 years ago, they went out on a limb and invited me into their lives and home to help me reach my potential as a young adult. despite not knowing i existed for a big chunk of their lives, they sacrificed a lot so that i could become a successful adult and a close part of their family.part of that sacrifice was putting off starting their own family. sue and chris have always planned to have kids, but sue’s intense battles with endometriosis complicated things. with the constant pain and surgery, having their own children was proving difficult, both physically and financially, so they decided they absolutely wanted to adopt. however, juggling their accessibility business, helping their visually impaired and blind friends in the community, and taking on a 19 year old (me) didn’t exactly make it easy for them to make that happen. on top of all of this, they still each wanted to pursue their own education goals and finish their degrees.fast forward 13 years and sue and chris have finished their degrees, both immediately landing great jobs. three and a half years ago, they welcomed their beautiful son, mitchell, into their lives, finally becoming the wonderful parents they always wanted to be. and just last year, they bought their dream house in gainesville, fl, so they can be closer to work and family.success, it seems, does not come without hardship. sue had to have another surgery to help alleviate her endometriosis symptoms, which was the first major blow to their financial stability. the sudden death of sue’s father, stanley, was the next event from which we are all still recovering. because stan was the primary daytime caregiver, sue and chris were required to scramble to find childcare. soon after, sue had to have another major surgery due to a life-threatening abdominal infection. as she was recovering, a hail storm hit their home in trenton, causing them to relocated their whole life for months while repairs were being done. just as things were starting to settle, we got the news of chris’s cancer, and the medical bills are starting to feel insurmountable.again, anything you can do or give to help is greatly appreciated! all funds will go towards paying for chris’s chemotherapy and other medical expenses. any donations beyond that will be saved for mitchell’s college fund.\n",

            "curtis has a passion for helping people but now he needs our help! he needs our help to travel to pittsburgh for the removal of an aggressive pituitary tumor near his brain and left eye. at the age of 14 (in 2011) curtis was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor in which the surgeons gave their first attempt to remove but were unsuccessful. from then until 2015, the micro tumor remained dormant. however, in 2015 the tumor rapidly became a macro tumor resulting in the second attempt to remove it through his nose. the second attempt was also unsuccessful. the third attempt included a craniotomy or opening of the skull which was partially successful in removing the tumor.  this was followed by radiation. unfortunately, 15 months later the tumor started to grow back. currently, the tumor has grown back to a macro-size affecting his ability to open his left eye and causing severe headaches. curtis' treating physician at uf jacksonville is referring him to the best skull-based surgeon located at the university of pittsburgh medical center for the removal of the macro tumor.  with this surgery, curtis will continue his journey as a pre-med student and will be able to continue his ministry of praying for people, giving bible studies, feeding the homeless and becoming a medical doctor. please give to support the cost for curtis and his family's airfare, lodging and meals for the surgery and recovery period. they will be leaving the week of december 11th to pittsburgh so the funds are needed as soon as possible. we give god all the praise for what he has done and will continue to do.thank you for your help. it is truly appreciated!\n",

            "hi anyone,my baby is sick. orion is my sweet 7.5 year old wheaten terrier. i've had him since he was nine weeks old. orion has been undergoing some diagnostics for the past three months to try to figure out what is going on with him. he has had issues with throwing up and not being able to eat. currently i have him on a decent diet, but he has lost eight pounds, going from 38 pounds in october 2017 to 30 pounds yesterday february 2018. he has had eight blood tests, an x-ray,  four ultrasounds, and a minimally invasive biopsy (for which he had to be fully sedated) that came back inconclusive . he has had elevated calcium levels in his blood for these past few months which can negatively impact his kidneys, but his kidney values are fine for now. however, the elevated calcium can be because it's being released from a tumor or tumors. the past three ultrasounds have been of his neck because he has multiple masses growing there. the masses have been putting pressure on his trachea and esophagus and causing him to not be able to eat solid food and limiting his airway slightly to where he has been snoring in his sleep and coughing every day. he is taking a steroid to help reduce what inflammation can be reduced, but since the masses are growing, it is minimal.yesterday, i received some not so great news from the internal medicine vet i've been seeing. he had another blood test and ultrasound of his neck. the calcium is increasing and the size of the masses are increasing. it is suggested that he has some sort of cancer, but a definitive diagnosis cannot be determined without a surgical biopsy of a mass. i have been using a medical credit card to pay for his diagnostics so far that have totaled $2,450. the vet told me i have two options right now.  1) proceed with a surgical biopsy of a mass to see what's going on and what could be done about it, likely radiation, if anything.2) proceed with how we are caring for him now. which ultimately would mean the masses keep growing to where he would have difficulty eating at all and eventually his airway would be blocked. at that point, i'd have to decide whether or not it would be worth that quality of life for him to keep him alive.i started crying in the exam room.the reason i am trying this is because even the possibility of figuring out what is going on with him and potentially saving his life is limited to the fact that i can't afford it.i have enough on this medical credit card to cover the surgical biopsy ( i think) but that's it. after that i wouldn't have anything left to go towards treatment if it's available.he still has at least half of his life to live. he is energetic and loves everyone. even more than his will to love and be loved is my love for him. i don't want to leave his life to getting more and more sick until he has to be put down because that isn't fair to him. he is still so young and it is heartbreaking to me to think about every day. for me to think about every time he is laying on the floor just looking at me with those amber eyes of innocence that expect me to care for him. i don't expect many to help or for it to be successful or to even be able to do anything at all except for give him all of my love every day, but i have to try. this is a step in trying. i can't just let my baby go without trying. if you are able and willing to help me by donating then i would be forever grateful and never know how to repay you. thank you for even listening.\n",

            "it’s no stranger to anyone how expensive graduate school is. i have accepted an offer from the university of miami’s masters in health administration program come fall 2020. i am really quite nervous to make this go fund me, and aside from applying for scholarships which i have done/am currently doing this is my only means besides going into deep student debt. my father had been diagnosed with end stage renal failure, and had been receiving dialysis through a neck port for about a year. my father decided that his quality of life was no longer at a place that he wanted to fight for, and that he would be ending dialysis at the end of the year (3 months away at the time). this is when i stepped up and underwent screenings to donate my kidney to my father, and after countless attempts i was successful. we had about a 15% chance of being a match, although i am a universal donor he has had many blood transfusions. but i prayed and i leaned on those around me for support, and my prayers were answered. this past october i underwent the procedure to donate my kidney to my hero, to my dad. my father has been out on disability for years and will continue that way and has no means to support my education. a little background on why i have chosen this route is prior to the kidney donation i was planning on going into the field of nursing, but during my many hospital stays i experienced battles with the hospital staff and had a first hand experience on the interplay between the nurses, physicians, and various administrative roles. i had underwent complications with my first surgery, and had to undergo a second emergency surgery 2 weeks post op, and it was during this time of struggle that i realized where my impact was needed, and that was through the role of a hospital administrator. i aspire to be someone in a place of power within our broken health care system that stands for the right morals. i want to ensure my staff will never treat patients the way i was treated. i want to reform the system from the inside, and help bring our humanity back into the “business” of health (it should have never gone this far into a business platform). i believe that i cannot do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good i can do. i am dedicated to improving lives, as seen with donating my kidney to my father. fact of the matter is, i would do it again.. for anyone that needs it if i could. like our healthcare, education should be affordable. i ask that if you find it in your heart to help me, that you do. i want to change the world, and i know i can if i am given the chance.\n",

            "ferdinand needs your help to pay for his sight saving surgery and care!with his former rescue not able to afford ferdinand’s expenses and care and the smyth family (suckers for a sob story in an adorable package named ferdinand and simply in love with the little guy who has been deemed an ocular lemon) fred has been granted a forever home with his former foster family tyler, madeline, loren and david smyth. ferdinand was adopted with ongoing issues in his eyes due to the large expense his rescue could not burden.ferdinand has a very rare condition that causes painful pressure spikes and glaucoma in his eyes. wednesday 11/11/15, he had emergency surgery to save his eye & vision. the pressure in his right eye spiked to over 70mmhg when it should be around 15mmhg. this was incredibly painful and in order to relieve the pressure, surgery was performed. his surgical story has not come to an end. with one eye partially saved after round the clock medical care and a hefty bill we still need your help!due to the emergency nature of his initial surgery ferdinand has kept mid and long rang vision in his right eye but sadly the damage was too great to save all of his vision and replace his occular lens. with the genetic nature of his condition both of his eyes are affected and ferdinand now is prepping for a more intense surgery in his left eye. with the proper surgical precare and timing we are hopeful the fabulous opthomology team at uf veterinary hospital will be able to save all of the vision in his left eye! we under a time crunch since while the daily eye drops are keeping his pressures at a high normal level, there is every chance the emergency situation that occurred with his right eye will occur again. surgery is being scheduled for late april 2016 in which lens removal through complete lens extraction and laser of the ciliary bodies within the globe that produce the intraocular fluid leading to his increased pressure as well as replacement of the lens to preseve short range vision will occur. the cost of this sugery is estimated at between $3800 and $4200 and does not include any of the follow up or medicinal costs to be shouldered by the adoptive family. each visit to uf adds approximately $60-75 dollars to ferdinand’s medical bill. each month his eye drops cost between $120 and $150 dollars depending on the drops being dispensed. the smyths have been more than willing to take on ferdinand and his occular issues, providing around the clock eye meds and consistent act follow up care but the cost of the surgery is a large burden and our family could sincerely use your help. an inital deposit of 75% of larger estimated cost ($3150) must be put on deposit for ferdinand's surgery before the surgery can take place. we are hoping to collect that by april 1, 2016.  all  funds will be going directly to uf veterinary small animal hospital to cover the costs of the left eye surgery. we (the smyth family) have pledged to get this pup the care he needs so keep as much vision as possible no matter the cost.thank you so much for your kind support and contribution. ferdinand and his adoptive family thank you!sincerely, maddie (age 10) tyler (age 13) loren, and david smyth\n",

            "2020 has not been the year for anyone. our friend, amanda jolly, has had a rough go this year and to make things worse she just found out her beloved riley needs surgery. jolly would do anything for riley, understandably so, and i thought maybe we could all do something for jolly. i think most of us have experienced the high medical and vet bills and have often wanted just a little help. i know we have all been pretty financially strapped this year and it’s hard to give when it seems every organization known to man is asking for donations. for those that know jolly know that she would give the shirt off her back to help someone in need. she has countless times bought food for others, bought gifts and even let me live with her while i struggled to find a place for myself. she’s the kindest heart you could ever expect to come in contact with. so if you have a few dollars to share please know you’re donating to warm jolly’s heart by helping riley out.\n",

            "imagine being stuck in your hospital room for 12 days during covid-19, all alone and not allowed to have visitors, while doctors and nurses perform surgeries, tests and procedures to determine what was causing months of pain and discomfort.  and then to receive the news you feared- your cancer has returned, and it is stage 4.  it would take great strength and faith to process everything going through your mind without your network of friends and family physically at your side (although absolutely with you in spirit and via limited calls and texts). unfortunately, that is what happened to my sister-in-law, denise schaney lowenstein in april.  and this stage 4 breast cancer diagnosis came after she and her husband, joe (my brother), were home for a few months because of the lockdown and joe's work being considered ‘non-essential’.   denise works at a church and they have been extremely supportive, helpful and generous letting her work from home and helping with meals and other gifts , but joe works in construction so when he is not working, he is not earning.we are starting this campaign to raise money for denise and joe lowenstein to help with their medical bills, rent and other living expenses as denise fights cancer for the second time.  we are raising this money to give them one less thing to worry about during the next several months of chemotherapy as denise and her body take on cancer.  she is a strong and stubborn fighter who i am sure will kick cancer’s butt but that tenacity will not pay expenses.  and even though some work restrictions are slowly being lifted, it has been difficult for joe to leave while denise needs continued care.several friends and coworkers have already generously given, which is sincerely appreciated.  after many years of friendship and caring, many others have asked how they can help.  denise has supported so many people over the years, including helping care for my aging parents, and now we have an opportunity to return the love.all help is appreciated, even if that is just to share this message with people in your circle who might know denise, joe, or their children, diana and damon, or grandson, colin.and of course, the greatest gift you can give is saying a prayer and offering positive thoughts for denise.  we are all praying for a full and speedy recovery for denise.  we also pray for god’s comfort to her and her family over the next few months- especially during the grueling process of chemotherapy. updatedenise had her first chemotherapy on may15th.  she had the predicted side effects of the treatment but within a week, there were complications and she was readmitted to the hospital and is currently being treated to restore normal breathing.  fortunately, florida has eased the lockdown restrictions and denise can recover with family at her side.  continued prayers please.\n",
